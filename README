A simple Arduino sketch that allows one to read the raw
data from any Wiegand interface. Seems to work pretty well,
not sure where I want to go with the project.

Maybe a format guesser?

Make sure you wire data0 and data1 correctly, and ensure the ground of your 
Arduino is the same as the ground for your card reader.
